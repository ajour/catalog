With this addon installed, you'll gain access to an easy way to view Mythic Keystone scores, Raid Progress, and Recruitment status for players-- all without leaving the game!OverviewSimply hover over a player with your mouse, your guild roster, or even the Group Finder list where you see queued people; if they meet the minimum qualifications then you'll see their score and best run in the tooltip.Additionally, you can right-click players from the standard target unit frame to Copy Raider.IO URL and then easily look up their full profile on the site. With this functionality you can directly paste these URLs anywhere on Raider.IO to navigate to that player's profile page.RecruitmentWith the Raider.IO Recruitment features you can now also see whether a player is looking for a guild/team, or if they are recruiting for their own guild/team. This will show up as a line in the tooltip as follows:You can right click on any player that is recruiting and hit Copy Recruitment URL to copy a URL that you can paste into your browser to view more details of the recruitment profile.Because recruitment information can change regularly, we encourage people to use the Raider.IO Desktop Client to keep this data in sync.If you have run into any problems, check out our FAQ at https://raider.io/faq, or join us on Discord at: https://discord.gg/raider in #addon-discussions -- we always have people around willing to help.Getting StartedThe easiest way to get started is to use the RaiderIO Desktop Client: https://raider.io/addonOnce installed you can load into the game and you will start seeing Mythic+, Raiding, and Recruitment details  on players around you. This AddOn works by storing a snapshot of character data from Raider.IO and then using that to populate information on qualified players.To qualify for inclusion in a snapshot, players must meet specific criteria based on the type of data:Mythic PlusHave earned at least 200 points in the current or previous season. Honored and higher patrons do not have a minimum score requirement in order to be shown in the addon.Have logged in to the game within the past 14 daysRaidingHave defeated at least 30% of the bosses (rounded up) in either Normal, Heroic, or MythicRecruitmentAll active and public recruitment profiles are available in-gameRemember: We update the addon with the latest scores and top runs multiple times each day. Update regularly to ensure you are seeing the freshest information. Using the RaiderIO Desktop Client you can keep your addon updated automatically!Detailed Addon UsageOur intent with this AddOn is to provide an easy way for people to get some information at a glance when forming groups. There is no substitute for talking with your fellow players, so be a pal and listen if an applicant whispers you. These are the fields we show, and when we show them:Character Raid &amp; Mythic+ TooltipsRaid information in tooltips simply lists the best progress seen for the player.Mythic+ tooltips have a lot of parts to them:Raider.IO M+ Score: This is the overall score for this character. If the score is from a previous season, then the value of the score is rounded to the nearest 10s, and is prefixed with ±. You can also identify the previous season score by looking for the (S#) suffix on the tooltip headline.Best Run: This will indicate the Mythic+ level for the player's best scoring run, along with the specific dungeon. Up to three plus signs + will be prefixed to the keystone level to indicate how much the keystone was upgraded during that run. Note: when this keyword is highlighted green it means that the player's Best For Dungeon is also the same as their overall Best Run.Best For Dungeon: You'll see this line when using LFD to form or join a Keystone group. This will show the Mythic+ level of the player's best scoring run for the chosen dungeon.Timed #+ Runs: These lines indicate how many M+ runs have been completed by this player within the timer over the course of the current season. The player's two highest categories of Timed Runs will show by default.Main's Best M+ Score / Main's Current M+ Score: This indicates the best character score on this player's account, if they have registered on Raider.IO and linked their Battle.Net account. This will only show if the Main's Score is greater than the current character's score. If someone has a good score on their main, then much of their prior experience will help them perform better in dungeons while on their alt.Role icons included on Mythic+ tooltips can be thought of as badges earned by accumulating certain amounts of score while playing as that role. Fully opaque icons indicate they've earned at least 80% of their overall score in that role. Semi-transparent role icons indicate they have earned at least 40% of their overall score in that role.Recruitment TooltipsWe currently determine the profile to show based on a priority order for the entity and activity type. Our overall rationale is that we want the most common organized activities to take precedence when choosing what to show in-game.Guild + Raiding (only recruiters)Guild + Guild Mythic+ (only recruiters)Team + Team Mythic+ (only recruiters)Character + RaidingCharacter + Guild Mythic+Character + Team Mythic+Guild + Guild PVP (only recruiters)Guild + Guild Social (only recruiters)Character + Guild PVPCharacter + Guild SocialNote: Anyone in your guild who has access to the Recruitment information will show your group's recruitment profiles in-game. Meaning, it is based on the roles given to each rank. These ranks will show the tooltip in game, and will also be able to access recruitment information on the site:GM / CaptainOfficerRecruiterCharacter Profile TooltipsYou can view your personal M+ and Raid Progress profile when you open the Dungeon Finder. This will be shown as a large tooltip alongside the Dungeon Finder frame with additional details about your per-dungeon performance.This can be used to help understand what dungeons you should try to focus on in order to raise your score.By default when you are in the Dungeon Finder it will show your own profile. However, you can press a modifier key (Shift/Alt/Ctrl/Cmd) to show the target character's full profile instead. There is also a config option to invert this behavior.Keystone TooltipsYou can view additional details when hovering over Mythic+ Keystone items, such as:The highest key completed for each member of your group for the dungeon you are in, or queued for.Avg. Timed +# Player Score: This is the rounded median score of players who have successfully completed Mythic+ runs in time at this level. This data is sampled from the past 60 days of runs tracked on Raider.IO, and it excludes the top and bottom 1% of scores at each level. This is intended to provide a guide for the type of score you might consider when forming or joining a group based on data seen across all players.Group SearchYou can pull up detailed information for all the characters in your group at once by utilizing the Raider.IO Group Search feature.Click the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the Dungeon FinderCopy the text in the window that pops upGo to https://raider.io and hit Ctrl-V or Cmd-V to paste this while the site is in the foreground.This will then take you to the Raider.IO Advanced Search page for all the characters in your group.Copy Character Raider.IO URLClick the &quot;Copy Raider.IO URL&quot; buttonCopy the text in the window that pops upGo to https://raider.io and hit Ctrl-V or Cmd-V to paste this while the site is in the foreground.This will take you to that character's profile page.In-Game Character Search (Advanced)You can look up any character in the current database by using the /rio search command.When you type this, you will be presented with a small frame where you can enter the realm name and character name to search for. If they are found, then their information will be pulled up and displayed.You can type /rio search to hide the window.Configuring the AddOnOur recommended settings are enabled by default, but we've provided several options to customize how and where the tooltips might show while in-game. Type /raiderio to open the Raider.IO options frame. Alternatively, you can also find a shortcut in the Interface &gt; AddOn settings frame.Here you can easily enable or disable various features, including whether to show scores from each faction, and various tooltip customization options.Remember to click &quot;Save&quot; to save the changes, or &quot;Cancel&quot; to abort and close the dialog.Score Color TiersScores map to a specific color based on their range. We've followed the standard WoW quality colors, but added additional gradients between the base values to provide more brackets to ascend through. These tiers are recalculated based on actual scores.Patreon RewardsInterested in supporting development of Raider.IO and getting some rewards while you're at it?

We wanted to provide anyone in the community a simple way to tap into the scores that are a part of this addon.

To begin using TellMeWhen, right-click on one of these icons, and the icon editor will appear. You need to select an icon type from the dropdown menu and enable the icon, and then configure the icon to suit your needs based on the settings that are available. An explanation of what most settings do can be found in the tooltip displayed when you mouse over a setting.You can also drag spells from your spellbook, your pet's spellbook, or items from your inventory to quickly set up a cooldown icon for that spell/item. Icons can be spatially manipulated by holding down the right mouse button and dragging them around. When they are dropped on another icon, a menu will appear asking you what you want to do with the icon - Options include Move, Copy, and Swap.General settings can be accessed via '/tmw options', the Blizzard interface options, or the 'Group Settings' tab of the icon editor.All available slash commands are:'/tmw' - Toggles TellMeWhen between locked (functional) or unlocked (configuration) states.'/tmw options' - Opens the general settings configuration for TellMeWhen.'/tmw profile &quot;Profile Name&quot;' - Loads a TellMeWhen profile. Profile name is case sensitive, and must be quoted if it contains spaces. (E.g. '/tmw profile &quot;Cybeloras - Aerie Peak&quot;').'/tmw enable global|profile groupID iconID' - Enables the specified group or icon (E.g. '/tmw enable 2 4' or '/tmw enable global 3').'/tmw disable global|profile groupID iconID' - Disables the specified group or icon (E.g. '/tmw disable profile 2 4' or '/tmw disable 3').'/tmw toggle global|profile groupID iconID' - Toggles the specified group or icon between enabled and disabled (E.g. '/tmw toggle global 2 4' or '/tmw toggle profile 3').'/tmw counter counter-name +|-|/|*|= number' - Mutate a TMW counter. Counters can be checked in conditions or displayed on icons. (E.g. '/tmw counter casts = 0' or '/tmw counter phase + 1')'/tmw cpu' - Enables and displays a UI for measurements of icon performance. This is an advanced feature; no guidance on reading the data will be offered.ConditionsConditions are a very powerful feature of TellMeWhen that allow you to narrow the circumstances under which an icon or group should show. To configure conditions for an icon, click the condition tab on the Icon Editor. Conditions can check a wide variety of things, and I recommend that you explore the condition type menu to see what is available. You can add multiple conditions to an icon, and you can group different conditions together for use with the Boolean operators AND and OR by clicking the parenthesis between each condition.Conditions are also used for other purposes throughout TellMeWhen.Meta iconsMeta icons are one other special feature of TellMeWhen that makes it so powerful and versatile. Meta icons allow you to specify a list of other icons to check within the meta icon, allowing you to have a large number of icons for different situations show in the same location on your screen. By chaining meta icons togetherGroupsAll TellMeWhen icons belong to a parent group. Each of these groups have many settings; some affect their appearance and size, while other affect their functionality. The options for a group can be accessed by typing &quot;/tmw options&quot;, or by clicking the group settings tab on the icon editor. Groups can also have conditions set to govern when they are shown and hidden - accessed through the Group Conditions tab of the icon editor, they are configured exactly the same way as icon conditions.TroubleshootingPLEASE DIRECT ALL BUGS AND FEATURE REQUESTS HERE.PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTIONS TO THE TMW DISCORD.Make sure that TellMeWhen is not in configuration mode. Type '/tmw' to toggle configuration mode on and off.The most common problem people encounter is caused by not entering the name correctly during configuration. Make sure you enter names EXACTLY as they are named when you mouse over them. For buffs this is often different from the ability/totem/trinket/enchant/talent which casts the buff, so be sure to check. Known buffs and debuffs are shown as a dark purple or a warrior brown color in the suggestion list.If the name of the ability does not work properly, use the SpellID. SpellIDs can be found by looking at the suggestion list that pops up as you begin typing in the name, or by finding the ability on a site such as Wowhead. The spellID is in the url, for example: www.wowhead.com/spell=53351Check the settings of the icon's group.Check the icon's settings in the other tabs of the icon editor.DonationsIf you enjoy using TellMeWhen or if it has helped out your game-play considerably, please consider donating so that I may be able to afford time to develop more new features.

Presets use a combination of direct info placeholders to return a formatted layout, while direct info placeholders simply use 1-2 API calls to return it's output with very minimal formatting.Some placeholders may not be available in some clients, either due to API instability or simply because the API call(s) it uses do not exist.While this list is quite expansive, users can create their own placeholders with the /cp placeholders command.Creating more advanced layouts might require some Lua experience, as well as experience with the World of Warcraft APIs. Usage of the Events section may also be needed if your placeholder requires the usage of specific in-game events that this addon does not already have registered.Presence Display / Global PlaceholdersThese placeholders can be added within the Presence and Buttons menu within the Config Gui.These types of placeholders are designed for more generalized information, such as what to display in certain instances.

N at will/whim.It also works for brand new characters (making a new cool 5 Void Elf, team, just do it, no need to go back to windows)Q: Why is that useful?A:Because you save time and only need a handful of core teams and &quot;virtual&quot;/role based characters in isboxer instead of dozensQ: What else does it do ?A:A bunch of small utility things (and I can add more of you ask):It syncs up automatically your EMA team, in the order of the slots (no more &quot;can't push settings&quot; ever)It (optionally) auto invites your teamIt (optionally) auto converts to raid as needed, making for super fast 6+ team assemblyHas extensive mouse over tooltips in the addon options and key bindings sections to let you discover the featuresQ: How big/complicated is the setup?A:Turn on broadcasting and 3 keystrokes: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Enterdo that once, and you're done forever, even if you login 100 different teams!Q: Does it work cross realm ?A:Yes since 1.6 and that makes it a big time saver if you need to visit a lot of realms.In that setup I recommend you don't change the slot1 but change the other slot(s) and set the auto invite to say slot 2 so everyone phases to slot 2's realm (the changing realm)Q: I prefer to watch videos than read a wall of text !A:That's not a question, but a statement  You can watch this mini series:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TseQzm4Ktb4&amp;list=PLlutLO8wozeIy0U2htIL3O12bIE5cB1VA&amp;index=1Q: Do you have a demo?A:Yes (though it's a bit old, doesn't show the config UI or new commands, etc... and volume is lowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWGP20xmXTI&amp;list=PLlutLO8wozeIy0U2htIL3O12bIE5cB1VAQ: Is there anything that won't work with it but would work with pure isboxer team reload/change ?A:First if you log the original team in, you get the exact same functionality + fast auto invite, auto raid conversion if needed/enabled, auto EMA team sync etc... so it's only additive feature wise, you don't loose anythingBut yes, if you have a pro setup and try to swap say a Tank for a Healer in the same slot, DynamicBoxer will still remap the macros but they will be your Tank-style actions and thus not likely to be as helpful to your newly slotted Healer; yet if you you just need a quick swap in/out to collect some item, do a quest or anything of that sort, it will still save time and be functional (assist, broadcast, follow etc...), just don't go and do a Mythic + 20 with that setup :-)Q: Does it/will it work with Classic ?A:Yes ! and it's great to get going even if you don't have characters created yet!Q: I'm sold (or willing to try it), where do I get it?A:Wherever you like get your wow addons usually, typically on curse/twitch app or wow interface (search for &quot;DynamicBoxer&quot; with no space):https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dynamicboxerhttps://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25009-DynamicBoxer.htmlps: &quot;sold&quot; for free and opensource (it's here on github!)Q: How do I ask more questions?A:Ask here or catch me on discord","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100007","date":"2023-03-21T22:32:00.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicEra","game_version":"11403","date":"2023-03-21T22:32:00.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicTbc","game_version":"20504","date":"2023-03-21T22:32:00.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicWotlk","game_version":"30401","date":"2023-03-21T22:32:00.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":1088568,"name":"world-boss-timers","url":"https://github.com/fstenstrom/world-boss-timers","number_of_downloads":10831,"summary":"WorldBossTimersThis is the repo for the World of Warcraft addon &quot;WorldBossTimers&quot; which is used to track and share timers for world bosses.Curse addon site: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/worldbosstimersCurse project site: https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/worldbosstimersIf something is broken or you have a feature request, feel free to add an issue or comment on the Curse addon site.","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100005","date":"2023-03-06T17:50:25.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":1086310,"name":"Rarity","url":"https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity","number_of_downloads":10018,"summary":"Collectibles and statistics tracking addon for World of Warcraft: Dragonflight","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100002","date":"2022-11-18T11:54:50.000Z"},{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100002","date":"2022-11-18T11:54:50.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":1341353,"name":"REFlex","url":"https://github.com/AcidWeb/REFlex","number_of_downloads":9458,"summary":"REFlexWago AddonsWoWInterfaceCOPYRIGHTAll Rights Reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated.Copyright (c) 2013-2022 Paweł Jastrzębski pawelj@iosphe.re","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100007","date":"2023-03-22T07:19:22.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":31,"name":"RealUI","url":"https://github.com/RealUI/RealUI","number_of_downloads":7912,"summary":"RealUIRealUI is a minimalistic UI designed to be functional, yet also efficient and elegant.InstallationExit WoWMove your old World of Warcraft\\Interface and World of Warcraft\\WTF folders to a Backup folderCopy the Interface folder from the download in to your World of Warcraft\\ folder.Launch WoW and log inUpdateExit WoWCopy the Interface folder from the download in to your World of Warcraft\\ folder.Launch WoW and log inTroubleshooting/comments/questions?Find a bug or want to post a comment?

Nothing more is required.Enable nameplates with SHIFT+V (or from the add-on options) to see cool animations on characters playing music and show a 🎵 next to the name of your fellow music addicts.To mute a player, right-click on their name or portrait to open the menu then select Mute. Do the same to unmute.You can also just stop the song being played by clicking the [Stop] hyperlink in the player's emote.Right click on the minimap button to enable or disable all the music from the add-on.The characters currently playing music can be shown on the world map and the minimap.How to play musicMusician plays music files in MIDI format. MIDI files have a .mid, .midi or .kar extension and do not contain any sound like MP3s, but a sequence of notes. This is why a MIDI file sounds differently according to the software or musical instrument it's played on.💡 You can find millions of MIDI files very easily by searching for MIDI + music genre/title/etc. on Google. I also made a selection of cool music files you can try with the add-on.⚠️ Don't try to convert audio files such as MP3s or YouTube videos into MIDI, the result will be disappointing. This is a tedious work that can only be done manually by experienced musicians.How to play a songOpen the MIDI import tool located at musician.lenwe.io/import in your web browser. (You can also find the import tool in the Interface/AddOns/Musician/MidiConvert folder.)Drag and drop a MIDI file.Copy the generated music code by clicking the Copy button.Back in WoW, left-click on the minimap button to open the main menu then choose Import and play a song  to open the main window (or type /music).Click the Select all button then paste the music code in the edit window (Ctrl+V or CMD+V on Mac).Click Play.Save and load songs in gameSongs can be saved and loaded back in game using the optional add-on MusicianList.Play as a bandSongs can be played in sync as a band, in which each member is playing a different part.To allow synchronized play, all band members should be grouped in the same party or raid and have the same song loaded into Musician.Use the Link/Export button  to share songs with your band members.Load the same song as the other members of the band from MIDI, from the list or from a song chat link.Open the Song Editor then check Solo for the tracks you want to play with your character. Adjust other track settings as you like.Click the Play as a band button  when you're done (the green LED starts blinking).When every member is ready, the band leader clicks the Play button for synchronized start (the green LED turns on).Song stops playing if the band leader clicks the Stop button.Remarks:Mouse over the Play as a band button to check which members of the band are ready.Each band member can do all the changes they want in the Song Editor, except changing the start and end points that would result in being out of sync.Keep in mind that the overall polyphony can be limited and is shared among all the members of the band.Play liveLive Mode literally turns your computer keyboard into a piano.Click Open keyboard in the main menu or type /mus live to open the live keyboard.Configure the keyboardBefore using the keyboard for the first time, you have configure it to determine its physical layout.This process is straightforward and takes approximately 30 seconds to complete, just follow the on-screen instructions.The live keyboardThe live keyboard consists in two layers, Upper and Lower, respectively the two first and two last rows of your keyboard (or the right and left side, depending on the layout used). Each layer has its own instrument setting so 2 different instruments can be played at the same time or the same instrument can be set to both layers to take advantage of the full keyboard.Various keyboard layouts are available, including simplified ones with limited notes but a wider range of keys.The space bar acts like the sustain pedal of a piano.In Live Mode, the other players hear you playing while in Solo Mode, you play for yourself. In Live Mode, keep in mind that if you hear the sound playing instantly at the press of the key, the other players will hear it after a slight delay of approximately 2 seconds.The keyboard settings can be saved in 12 program slots, accessible using the 12 Function keys:Press the Function key to load a program.Press Ctrl (or Shift on Mac) + the Function key to save the current settings in a program.Press Delete + the Function key to erase a program.Play as a bandIt's possible to play as a band in Live Mode. All the members of the band should be grouped in the same party or raid.Click the Play live as a band button  on the live keyboard window to turn on the synchronization. In counterpart, this may result in some latency so you won't be able to play fast paced songs in this mode.Use the Solo Mode if you need to do some adjustments you don't want the other members of the band to hear.Enable nameplates to see who is playing what.Play with a MIDI keyboardThere is no support for MIDI keyboards in World of Warcraft. However, it's possible to emulate keystrokes with a MIDI keyboard using third party software. Check out the Musician MIDI add-on to learn how to achieve this.Song editorSome basic modifications can be made to the imported song in the song editor, which is accessible from the Edit button or the main menu:Set start and end points, to use a part of the songMute and solo tracksChange track instrumentsTranspose tracksAccent tracks, to make them louder by doubling the notesThe song editor also shows some information about the tracks (MIDI instrument, start and end points, number of notes…) and the activity while the song is playing. Click the track start or end point time code to reach it in the timeline.You can still change the track settings of the song currently playing by clicking the Synchronize track settings button  as long as you have the same song loaded in the editor.Share your songs with the other playersSongs can be shared with other players as links to be posted into the chat. Click the Link or Export button , set a title and you're done!The links remain active until you log out or reload the interface.Cross-faction playCross-faction (and cross-realm) music can be achieved on WoW Retail through the Cross RP add-on by Tammya-MoonGuard.This add-on is very straightforward, just install it and it works!Cross RP relies on a peer to peer network established by the players who run it so the faction/realm you want to play with may not be always reachable. Feel free to encourage other players to install Cross RP and expand the network!You can see what realms and factions you're connected to in Musician's options or by mousing over the Cross RP minimap button.Integration with role-playing add-onsMusician integrates with role-playing add-ons Total RP and MyRolePlay to benefit from some of their features, such as roleplaying character names and tooltips.Total RP's map scan feature shows players who also have Musician with a 🎵 icon. The icon blinks for players who are currently playing music.In addition, the Total RP Extended plugin allows you to export your songs as sheet music items that can be traded with other players. Click the Export button to create one.Tips and tricksYou can preview the song at any moment prior to playing it for other players by clicking the Preview button or using the song editor. If another song is playing nearby, it will be muted for you only.If another player has Musician, it will be shown in their tooltip. Just hover the other players with your mouse cursor to see who can hear you!Use toys such as the [Blingtron's Circuit Design Tutorial] and the [Fae Harp] to make your performance visually more immersive! (WoW Retail only)You can add lyrics by combining Musician with the StoryTeller add-on.Load and prepare the next song while the current one is playing to reduce waiting time between songs.The radius for hearing the music is approximately 40 meters.Play songs that are relevant with your &quot;band&quot; composition. It's nonsense to play orchestral music with only two bards ! 😃 However you can still role-play as if your character owns a kind of gnomish Music-o-Matic jukebox machine that is capable of reproducing a whole band.A text emote is shown to the players who don't have Musician when you play a song. You can disable this emote in the add-on options.Nameplates animations and icons are compatible with the most popular nameplate add-ons (KuiNameplates, Plater, ElvUI…).You can configure the add-on to use several audio channels to increase the maximum polyphony.Check out the wiki for more!Compose your own musicYou can compose music for Musician using any MIDI sequencer such as MidiEditor (free and cross-platform).The 18 melodic instruments available are:Lute (24 Acoustic guitar)Recorder (74)Celtic harp (46)Hammered dulcimer (15)Piano (0)Bagpipe (109)Accordion (22)Fiddle (110)Viola da gamba (ancient cello) (42)Female voice (53 Voice Oohs)Male voice (52 Choir Aahs)Trumpet (56)Sackbut (ancient trombone) (57)War horn (shofar) (60 French horn)Clarinet (71)Bassoon (70)Metal guitar (29)Clean Guitar (27)Bass guitar (33 Fingered bass)Percussions:Traditional percussion set (drum kit 0)Standard drum set (drum kit 16)War drums (47 Timpani)Woodblock (115)Tambourine shake (119)The other instruments are mapped to the closest-sounding instrument among the ones available (violin → fiddle, guitar → lute etc.).The drum kits are replaced by traditional percussions such as a bodhrán (frame drum), a tambourine and a shaker. A standard drum kit is also available for heavy metal songs.Check the full mapping in Musician.MidiMapping.lua for details.Unfortunately, due to limitations of the WoW UI, velocity and controls (volume, padding, pitch bend, modulation…) are not supported. The polyphony may be limited for some players, try to avoid songs having more than 12 simultaneous notes.Limitations and known issuesMusician has several issues that are due to limitations of the World of Warcraft API. Unfortunately, these can't be fixed but there are some tricks you can do to work around them:The volume of the music played with Musician can't be adjusted. Reduce the Master volume if it's too loud for you or if you're experiencing clipping. Setting the Master volume to 75% should deliver a comfortable experience in most cases.Musician has lots of audio files that need to be loaded into memory when the game starts. This results in a loading screen showing up or audio not playing properly for a few seconds after entering the game. Make sure you have more RAM than the minimum required by Blizzard. Run WoW on an SSD if possible. Avoid running too much applications in the background while you play WoW with Musician.Audio delay occurs when playing live on Windows, because WoW doesn't support low latency drivers such as ASIO or WASAPI. If you have a digital piano with MIDI output, you can use it with MusicianMIDI to play live, and rely on your direct instrument sound instead of Musician's (you can mute Musician using the minimap button).Music playing relies on the refresh rate of the screen so stuttering may occur on slower computers. Adjust your settings to maintain a framerate above 30 FPS for good results. Songs having an overly high note rate may stutter.There is no support for velocity and modulation in MIDI files.The volume of MIDI tracks can't be adjusted. However, each track has an Accent checkbox you can enable to double the notes and make the track sound louder.The polyphony is limited, some notes may drop if there are too many playing at the same time. By default, Musician uses the SFX and Dialog channels to reach a 64-note polyphony which is enough for 99,99% of the songs. Both channels' volume is set to 100% to make sure all notes play at the same level.The Play as a band feature does not work with trial accounts in raid mode.SupportIf you like Musician and want to support its development, the best you can do is to spread the word and invite your friends to install it! ❤️You can also toss a coin to your developer on Patreon or Paypal.🙏 Special thanks to the official supporters of the project:Grayson BlackclawChanceTheCheetahSelena - WRACriselliannaNaelyelAphexDerenly","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100007","date":"2023-03-20T18:58:41.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicEra","game_version":"11403","date":"2023-03-20T18:58:41.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicWotlk","game_version":"30401","date":"2023-03-20T18:58:41.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":5,"name":"Masque_Onyx","url":"https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque_Onyx","number_of_downloads":4245,"summary":"AboutMasque: Onyx is an add-on for World of Warcraft that adds a set of skins for Masque.SkinsThis set includes the following skins:Onyx - A dark skin with slightly rounded corners.Onyx Classic - The classic Onyx skin with arrow indicators.RequirementsThis add-on requires Masque.InstallationInstall the package through your preferred add-on manager or extract the archive to your add-ons directory.Retail: World of Warcraft\\_retail_\\Interface\\AddOnsClassic Era: World of Warcraft\\_classic_era_\\Interface\\AddOnsWrath Classic: World of Warcraft\\_classic_\\Interface\\AddOnsFeedbackFor bug reports and suggestions, use the issue tracker.

The Pro version is more complex and should be restarted every 20 minutes in trial mode. You can get a free license for any version if you send a postcard to the developers.Configuration for MacOSSome extra configuration steps are required for the setup to properly work on MacOS.1. Function keys configurationMusicianMIDI needs to the function keys to be enabled. Also make sure you don't have any shortcut using them.Go to System Preferences &gt; Keyboard.Check Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.Go to the Shortcuts tab.Click Mission Control and uncheck the Show Desktop shortcut if the F11 key is set (default).2. PermissionsBome MIDI Translator needs accessibility permissions to send keystrokes.Go to System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy.Click on Accessibility.Click on the padlock 🔒 to allow modifications.Check MIDI Translator Pro in the list.Configure the MIDI input deviceFor Bome MIDI Translator Classic:Connect your MIDI controller.Open the Midi In menu.Select your MIDI input device.For Bome MIDI Translator Pro:Connect your MIDI controller.Open the Musician preset.bmtp file that is provided in the Interface/AddOns/MusicianMIDI folder.Open the MIDI menu option then click Project Default MIDI Ports.Select your MIDI INPUT device in the right column under MIDI IN Port.How to playIn WoW, click on the Musician minimap icon then Open MIDI keyboard or type /mus midi. You can play live using your MIDI keyboard as long as the MIDI keyboard window is focused in game.The keyboard can be splitted in 2 layers to set a different instrument and/or octave on each side. Click the Split button to activate split mode. To change the split point, click on the split point text field then press the piano key you want as a new split point.The keyboard can also be activated by clicking the on-screen keyboard keys.Since MusicianMIDI relies on computer keyboard keystroke emulation, almost all the keyboard keys will trigger a note, including Esc and Enter. The MIDI keyboard window should remain open and the WoW application focused to work. Press the X button when you're finished to close the MIDI keyboard.The piano keyboard range goes from E1 (28) to G7 (103) which corresponds to a standard 76-key piano. Playing out of range keys has no effect.Deal with latencyAs with the regular live keyboard interface, you may experience some latency between the moment you press a key and when the sound actually starts playing, which can be awkward for a live performance. Unlike music applications, the WoW client does not support low latency ASIO drivers.If your keyboard can make its own sound (for example a digital piano) in addition to sending MIDI messages, do a right click on the Musician minimap icon to mute it entirely and use your instrument's audio for playing.If your keyboard is a controller only, you can connect it to a software synthesizer (in addition to Bome MIDI Translator) and use it for audio feedback while playing with Musician.Each Musician instrument has a soundfont version in SFZ format, located under Musician's soundfonts folder.Sforzando is a free SFZ soundfont player you can use as a standalone software synth to play Musician's instruments. Just assign the same Input MIDI device in Sforzando as in Bome MIDI Translator (under Tools &gt; Settings) and you're ready to go.To play an instrument, select it in game then drag and drop its .sfz file into Sforzando. Don't forget to mute Musician's audio in game by right clicking on the minimap icon to avoid hearing the sound twice.","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100007","date":"2023-03-20T19:00:42.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicEra","game_version":"11403","date":"2023-03-20T19:00:42.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicWotlk","game_version":"30401","date":"2023-03-20T19:00:42.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":1341355,"name":"REKeys","url":"https://github.com/AcidWeb/REKeys","number_of_downloads":578,"summary":"REKeysWago AddonsWoWInterfaceCOPYRIGHTAll Rights Reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated.Copyright (c) 2013-2022 Paweł Jastrzębski pawelj@iosphe.re","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100007","date":"2023-03-22T07:21:04.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":1599034,"name":"WoWDings","url":"https://github.com/LenweSaralonde/WoWDings","number_of_downloads":563,"summary":"WoW Dings emoticonsWoW Dings allows you to add funny symbols into your chat messages such as smilies, arrows, hearts etc. Just type the code corresponding to the symbol you want in your message, it will be automatically replaced.

Besides adding extra button to the interface, ithas a class of &quot;smart&quot; buttons that support, among other actions:Using the strongest/weakest food in the player's inventory.Using the strongest/weakest healthstone/mana gem in the player's inventory.Using a random mountChanging the button action depending on the current stance.Applying a poison to the weapon in the player's main hand.Many others, like auto-selling junk or restocking reagents or food.A smart button configured to use strongest food will change the item used ifthe player buys a stronger food, for example.Details of LunarSphereWhen it comes to &quot;sphere&quot; addons, examples that come to mind are the followingaddons:Cryolysis (Mage)HolyHope (Paladin)Necrosis (Warlock)Sabella (Rogue)Serenity (Priest)Totemus (Shaman)Venantes (Hunter)What separates this addon from the other sphere addons listed above is thatevery button is customizable. When you load up LunarSphere for the firsttime, you can load up a template for your specific class (Warriors, Druids,and now Death Knights have some sphere addon love) which will contain everyspell that your character knows and attach it to the sphere (if you level upand learn new spells, you'll need to manually add them to the sphere, or, ifyou never changed your sphere layout, you can just reload the templateagain).If you've never seen any of these addons, or need to know more aboutLunarSphere, here you go:InstallationJust extract a release file in the Interface\\AddOns folder for the gameversion you're playing:Retail (Mainline) : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\_retail_\\Interface\\AddOnsClassic (Vanilla) : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\_classic_era_\\Interface\\AddOnsBurning Crusade classic (TBC): C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\_classic_\\Interface\\AddOnsLunarSphere supports all three clients out-of-the-box, there are noclient-specific releases.FeaturesSphereLunarSphere gives you a large sphere on the screen. Around said sphere, youwill find 10 buttons that circle around it. These buttons, known as &quot;mainbuttons,&quot; can take left, middle, and right click assignments to store spells,items, or macros. These buttons can also be turned into menu buttons,allowing an additional 12 buttons per menu button to exist, giving a total of130 total buttons that you could possibly use, if you desire. The sphere canalso function like a button, making the total up to 131 buttons.Sphere Gauges/DisplayThe sphere provides up to two gauges (They look like rings or circular bars)that can display certain information such as health, mana, experience, rep,combo points, and more. You can also set text to be displayed on the middlesection of the sphere, to also display your health, mana, rep, and more.ButtonsThe buttons can take actions that to assign them, but there are also specialbutton types that you can assign the the button, such as &quot;Use strongestwater,&quot; &quot;Use random epic flying mount,&quot; &quot;Apply best Instant Poison toMain-hand&quot; and more. Some can be seen as specific for certain classes, otherbutton types can be used by all. Lots of &quot;auto bar&quot; type action assignmentswill happen within LunarSphere, if you assign such actions.Reagent RestockingLunarSphere can restock reagents from a custom list you define. Helpful fortailors who constantly need to restock on thread, or rogues you need poisons,hunters with ammo, priests with candles, and more.Random SpeechesThe random speeches that were trademark of most sphere addons? Yeah,LunarSphere can do that too. The addon comes pre-loaded with a few speechesfor your mounts and for resurrecting people, but the sky is the limit sinceyou can create your own speeches and assign them to items and spells that areused. Great for roleplayers, great for people who want to annoy their raid,or make them laugh.SkinningLunarSphere lets you skin the buttons with over 38 circular button skins andany color tinting you want to apply to them. LunarSphere was built to becustomizable to fit most, if not all interfaces, no matter the color ordesign.And more!Tooltip handling and coloring, junk item selling, bank restocking, userinterface object hiding (such as the action bar artwork, the main menubuttons, the mini-map zoom buttons, and more), and more can be handled byLunarSphere. If you want to use it as a full action bar replacement, you canhide all the action bars, assign the menu buttons and bag opening features toLunarSphere buttons, and clean up your screen.Memory managementA lot of the extra bells and whistles of LunarSphere can be disabled so thatit doesn't tie up lots of memory. In fact, with all features running,LunarSphere runs on about 850kb of memory and can replace between 3 and 10addons, depending on the features used.LongevityLastly, LunarSphere was made to last. When new drinks, food, potions, mounts,bandages and more are added to World of Warcraft, LunarSphere will usuallypick up those new items without a version update. When new spells come out,you can just add them to your sphere just like dragging a spell from yourspellbook to an action bar. That's some of the power and flexibility thatLunarSphere provides, so that the only time you need to update LunarSpherewill be for bells and whistle feature updates or bug fixes, but never so thatyou can finally use your new spell.Discord ServerThe watering hole for Lunarspherians is the LunarSphere Discord server athttps://discord.gg/qdwhkfXwCUFeel free to drop in, ask questions, make suggestions, or just hang out.I go by Fullmoon_druid there. Please feel free to ask for any questions orfeatures that you'd like to be added.User Manual and various help that might be neededLunarSphere doesn't have a user manual, but Dreambound's blog postis pretty close to one.LunarSphere can be overwhelming at first. Lots of beta testers who helped withthe project have said that after getting used to it, LunarSphere becamereally easy to setup and use, and they loved the power it provides.Bug Reporting, Feature Requests, Comments and MoreThe ideal place to fill bug reports is LunarSphere git repo athttps://github.com/leonardopsantos/LunarSphereIt's OK to post bug report on Curse or on Discord.

AutoGear rolls &quot;need&quot; on upgrades and &quot;greed&quot; otherwise.AutoGear also optionally interacts with quest NPCs, automatically accepting and completing quests, including deciding the best quest reward based on the same stat weights. If no item is deemed to be an upgrade, the item worth the most vendor gold is chosen.Included in AutoGear are default stat weights for all specs of all classes. Using these weights, AutoGear will roll &quot;need&quot; on better loot and equip it for you when it can.Stat weights work like the advanced filter on WoWhead. For example, if you specify that 1 point of strength is worth 1 point and 1 point of crit is worth 0.5 points, an item with 5 strength and 3 crit will be worth 6.5 points. That item might then replace an item in the same slot with 3 strength and 2 crit, worth 4 points. If the first item was presented in a loot roll, AutoGear would roll &quot;need&quot; and if you won the roll, it would equip the new item as soon as it could.The default stat weights may not be what you prefer. If you want to change them, stat weights for all classes and specs can be found in the &quot;SetStatWeights()&quot; function in &quot;[wow]\\Interface\\AddOns\\AutoGear\\AutoGear.lua&quot;. Simply edit the numbers there, save the file, and type &quot;/run ReloadUI()&quot; to update. A GUI for setting stat weights would be nice, but the authors haven't been motivated to make one yet. Code patches are welcome. This includes improvements to AutoGear's current stat weights, which sometimes need updating due to WoW class balance changes.If you receive an upgrade mid-combat, AutoGear queues the upgrade to be equipped when combat ends. It used to equip weapon upgrades immediately because weapons could be changed in combat, but due to addons that automated weapon swaps in combat for DPS at maximum level, Blizzard now prevents addons from swapping weapons in combat automatically. You can still equip them manually earlier than AutoGear can if you notice you've received a weapon upgrade.Chat commands:/ag - options menu/ag help - chat commands/ag scan - manually run automatic gearing once (scan all bags for better gear)/ag spec - query name of current specialization/ag toggle/[enable/on/start]/[disable/off/stop] - toggle automatic gearing/ag quest [enable/on/start]/[disable/off/stop] - toggle quest handling/ag party [enable/on/start]/[disable/off/stop] - toggle automatic acceptance of party invitations/ag verbosity [0/1/2]: set allowed verbosity level; valid levels are: 0 (errors), 1 (info), 2 (details)Warning: AutoGear currently automatically rolls &quot;greed&quot; on everything that isn't a gear upgrade for the current spec, including mounts and crafting reagents. It works quite well for leveling quickly and conveniently, but you should disable it before loot rolls you want control over. To do so, simply run &quot;/ag toggle&quot; or toggle it from the options menu.Warning: AutoGear is not recommended for use at max level. Its weights are not optimal, nor are stat weights ideal for determining upgrades in end-game content. AutoGear is meant primarily as a convenience for leveling quickly. Using it at max level, especially in team PvE or PvP, is likely to get you kicked from various groups and guilds. Calculating proper upgrades using SimulationCraft is preferable. This will be very time-consuming, but worth it for your powerful max-level character.","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100000","date":"2023-01-27T14:51:58.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicEra","game_version":"11403","date":"2023-01-27T14:51:58.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicTbc","game_version":"20504","date":"2023-01-27T14:51:58.000Z"},{"flavor":"ClassicWotlk","game_version":"30401","date":"2023-01-27T14:51:58.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":2797819,"name":"CratisDFQuests","url":"https://github.com/Cratis1831/CratisDFQuests","number_of_downloads":0,"summary":"CratisDFQuestsThis addon will drop side quests during leveling in Dragonflight which are deemed non-optimalThe &quot;optimal&quot; list of side quests are based off of the work of amzeus (discord: amzeus#4876) and his spreadsheet:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WZk2jRYKMYBj0Oewjlr2yFreAMxN6NHCgD1jx6n_YoE/edit#gid=1506321138Addon Options:Allow to auto drop quest or askPlay a sound when quest is dropped","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100002","date":"2022-11-27T14:02:47.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":2797815,"name":"GatheringTracker","url":"https://github.com/Noshei/GatheringTracker","number_of_downloads":0,"summary":"GatheringTrackerGathering Tracker is a simple addon that lets you display how many of any item you have gathered.Features:Ability to display TSM price dataCan track any item in the gameCustomizable appearanceCommands:/gt or /gatheringtracker will open the addon configurationsIssues/Support:for any issues support or feature requests please submit an issue over on Github.","versions":[{"flavor":"Retail","game_version":"100005","date":"2023-02-09T21:57:48.000Z"}],"categories":[],"source":"Hub"},{"id":2797809,"name":"JackJack","url":"https://github.com/fechan/JackJack","number_of_downloads":0,"summary":"JackJackAdds TomTom waypoints based on location name.

(i.e. mine is #)Press your magic key to pick up the perfect mount for here and now.Enjoy Mounty #TLV and take a look and all the other options and possibilities.DonationsMounty #TLV is big fun. But also became a lot of work. So I'm happy abount any donation, which makes the fun even bigger and the work a little lighter. ;)Paypal: thank.you.tlv@gmail.comThank you so much!ManualSo, always the perfect mount in any given situation!If you are lucky and got a few mounts in your collection, then it's quite simple to name the right mount to summon in every situation. Depending on the actual circumstances you are in.Mounty #TLV offers 7 categories for your mounts:Ground mounts - Mounts, which are big fun to ride, always with their feet on the ground.Flying mounts - These can spread their wings or ignite their rockets to reach for the sky, with you on their back.Dragonflight - Two wings, spitting fire, dead eyes and faster than the devil. Ride the dragons!Water mounts - There are/were mounts which could walk on the water. At least there are few which are faster swimmers than others, so you don't have to hold your breath too long.Repair mounts - You got one of these, haven't you? Or do you still have to run miles to the next anvil, to get bat to 100% durability?Taxi mounts - A passenger's seat for a good friend is perfect for questing, farming, and fighting together hand in hand. Especially when your taxi has wings, and your friend doesn't know how to fly. He'll never forget your helping wing erm hand.Show off mounts - You spent hours, days, weeks to get this special one, the mount of your dreams. There will never be a better one. Until tomorrow. But for now, everybody around must see: You got it!You can assign up to 110 different favourite mounts to every category per drag &amp; drop from your mount collection.And you can assign this one and only magic key, which does its magic when pressed.3 more, just for youSince v2.5.2 you can use 3 additional custom categories. Those don't play any part in the magic of Mounty #TLV, but you can summon them via key bindings. Your very special mounts for these very special moments.The magic that happensThere is a well defined logic behind the magic of Mounty #TLV and you can even customize it with some options (see Options below).Here we go!In the end its quite simple. When the magic key is pressed, it goes like this:Are you already on a mount?Then dismount and get down unless you're flying high and might fall at Hogger's feet. Then do nothing.But beware: If parachute mode ist enabled, Mounty #TLV will dismount you at any height and it's up to you to make a proper touch down.You have not mounted yet?Then let's do the real magic and get you the mount you crave for.You just killed thousands of enemies and your durability is lower than the threshold via options? Summon your repair mount and be reborn.You're soaking wet, swimming and surrounded by endless water? If amphibian mode is active, your water mount will appear every second summoning!You're on the Dragon isles in a dragon flight zone and you already experienced what it is like to be storm born? Mate, its time to wake the dragon!You hang around with friends and your taxi mode is on? My friend, we call for a taxi mount to ride away together. Hop on!You are in a resting area and show off mode is activated? Time to impress everyone around with one of your favourite show off mounts.You're in a flight zone, all alone? Spread your wings or start your engines and up, up, up it goes with your favourite fly mount.You're in a flight zone with friends but didn't activate together mode? Jump on your fly mount and race the skies with your friends.It is sad that you can't fly, and it gets worse, cause you're floating in cold water, but at least now you will summon your water mount to get back to the beach asap.None of the above did come true: Now it's time to get back to where it all started by climbing on the back of these good old ground mounts and take your ride to all five horizons.Magic done. By Mounty #TLV.The full magic in less wordsMagic key is pressed, so now ...You are on a mount ...... and not flying -&gt; Dismount... and flying, with parachute enabled -&gt; Dismount... and flying -&gt; Do nothingYou have not mounted ...Your durability is lower than xx% (see options) -&gt; Repair mountYou are swimming, Amphibia mode is on -&gt; (every second time) Water mountYou are on the Dragon isles and in a flight zone -&gt; DragonYou are a party member, taxi mode is on -&gt; Taxi mountYou are in a resting area, show off mode is active -&gt; Show off mountYou are in a flight zone, all alone -&gt; Fly mountYou are in a flight zone with friends and together mode is off -&gt; Fly mountYou are swimming -&gt; Water mountelse -&gt; Ground mountBut there is still more than thatMounty #TLV will choose the perfect category as described above. But there might be empty categories you didn't or couldn't assign any mount to.In this case there is a fallback:If a category is empty, it will then select one of your flying mounts. And if there are none, too, it will select one of your ground mounts. And if those are also missing, then there is only one last thing Mounty #TLV can do for you: Randomly summon any mount out of your whole collection, preferring your favourites if there are any.ExceptionsException 1: As long as you haven't given to fly yet, ground mounts will always be prefered before dragons and fly mounts.Exception 2: In flyable resting areas only flyable show off mounts will be chosen.And why was a certain mount chosen?The magic is kind of complex but it it transparent too.Mounty #TLV will keep a history of it's last 10 summonings and you can take it look at it anytime.Type /mounty why to see the newest (= last) entry.Type /mounty why 2-10 to see an older entry.Type /mounty why all to see all entries.You can also switch on Why mode to show the explanation automatically in the chat window after each summoning. (See: Options)How to configure and useType /mounty in the chat and the options frame will open.Mounty #TLV's option frame will also open automatically with the mount journal if option is not deactivated.And Mounty #TLV's option frame can be opened by clicking a button in the mount journal's bottom right corner.Drag &amp; drop all your favourite mounts into the categories of your choice. Click right on a mount to remove it from a category.You may copy an already assigned mount to another category by double clicking.Using the plus button you can open another frame to assign additional 100 mounts to a category. Here you can also easily transfer all filtered mounts from the mount journal into a category with 1 click, erm 2 clicks.WARNING: Mounty #TLV does never check if your assignments per category make any sense! You can assign any mount to every category. So: Please be reasonable!And Mounty #TLV will only summon mounts of a chosen category that can be used at that moment - regarding faction, class, or else.OptionsPer profileWhy mode - Every time after magically summoning a mount Mounty #TLV will tell you exactly, why the resulting mount has been chosen.Random mode - If on, Mounty #TLV will randomly summon a mount of the selected category. If off then it will cycle through one by one.Show off mode - In resting areas everybody should see one of your show off mounts. Because everybody must know, that you went fishing in Zereth Mortis for hundreds of hours, just to get this one and only jelly fish.Amphibian mode - Whilst swimming, alternate between water and flying mounts, because you might want to dive or you might want to fly away. Who knows?Together mode - Whilst you are in a party: Even if you are in a flight zone and have learned to fly, you won't take off but stay on the ground. Looking for any reason? If you're questing or farming with a friend who can't fly yet, then it's quite fair to stay with him and keep eye level. Except ...Taxi mode - You want to help a friend and give him some rides whilst questing and farming together, then turn this on. When in a party and you summon your mount, your taxi mount will arrive. Where do we go?How to call ... - Say it! When your taxi arrives this short line of text will be chatted, so your friend will hop on and not let you wait. (Only if in group)Service! - When your durability is lower than this and you look like Hogger's prey, give a big hand for your repair mount to appear.Account wideVia checkboxes you can decide between the following:Parachute mode - Always dismount anyway, no matter how high you fly and deep the fall. If disabled Mounty #TLV will keep you safe on your mount whilst flying.Auto open mode - The option frame will open and close automatically with the mount journal.Debug mode - Magic in numbers and letters. See for yourself what Mounty #TLV let's you know via chat messages.ProfilesYou can use different profiles like in many other addons.Also you can switch between account wide profiles or individual profiles for each character. And you can even copy profiles from global to individual and vice versa. Safety first: profiles will never be deleted nor overwritten but renamed if already existent.Also there is a new button in the mount journal to open Mounty #TLV. This can be positioned or be hidden by a slider.Command lineType in chat or use in macros:Version/mounty version - to show the current version of the addonSummoning/mounty magic - to let Mounty #TLV's magic happen/mounty dragonflight - to summon a Dragonflight mount/mounty fly - to summon fly mount/mounty ground - to summon ground mount/mounty random - to summon random mount/mounty repair - to summon repair mount/mounty showoff - to summon show off mount/mounty taxi - to summon taxi mount/mounty water - to summon water mountTell me why!/mounty why - to show the current entry/mounty why 2-10 - to show an older entry/mounty why all - to show all entries\\Profiles/mounty profile - to show the current used profile/mounty profile Heart - to switch to or create the profile Heart\\Options/mounty - to open the options frameSwitch options/mounty set amphibian on|off (Alternate between swimming and flying)/mounty set auto on|off (Auto open options frame)/mounty set debug on|off (Show debug info)/mounty set parachute on|off (Dismount at any height)/mounty set random on|off (Random or cycle throught)/mounty set showoff on|off (Show off, show off!)/mounty set taxi on|off (Use taxi mounts)/mounty set together on|off (Let's stay together)/mounty set why on|off (Output 'Why?' every time automatically)_/mounty set whyshort on|off (Set the output format to short or long)Binding keysUse system key bindings to assign your magic key.Besides the magic key you can also bind some special keys to summon a mount of a category of your choice.
